🚀 Milestone Progress

✅ Milestone 1: Data Collection & Preprocessing

Objective: Prepare a clean, labeled dataset for training

Key Work Done:

Collected raw email data in CSV format including sender details and message body

Performed NLP preprocessing:

Removal of URLs, email IDs, punctuation, and noise

Stopword removal

Lemmatization to normalize text

Labeled each email with:

Category: complaint, request, feedback, spam

Urgency: high, medium, low

Handled real-world issues:

Windows CSV encoding problems

Irregular delimiters and noisy enterprise data

Final cleaned dataset stored in CSV format for direct use in training pipelines

📌 Outcome: A robust, enterprise-ready labeled dataset suitable for ML model training
